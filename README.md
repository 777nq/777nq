## 👋 About Me

I’m a **full-stack developer** focused on building modern, fast, and scalable web applications.

I enjoy working on projects that combine **clean UI**, **smooth UX**, and **solid backend logic**. I care a lot about structure, performance, and making things feel polished, not just functional.

### 🛠 What I work with

* **Frontend:** React, TailwindCSS
* **Backend:** Python, Flask
* **Other:** REST APIs, automation, server-side logic

### 🚀 What I’m building

* Full-stack web apps from idea to deployment
* UI-heavy projects with smooth interactions
* Systems that are scalable, clean, and maintainable

Always learning, always improving, and pushing for higher-quality code and design.
